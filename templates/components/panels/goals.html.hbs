            The Rust 2024 Edition is planned for Rust v1.85 (beta 2025-01-03, stable 2025-02-20).
            It will include small changes to Rust to remove language pain points and increase coherence.
            As with any edition, crates can upgrade at their leisure, and crates running on older editions will continue to be supported and interoperate.

            Bring Async Rust closer to parity with sync Rust

            In 2024 we plan to deliver several critical async Rust
            building block features, most notably support for async
            closures and Send bounds. This is part of a multi-year program
            aiming to raise the experience of authoring "async Rust" to
            the same level of quality as "sync Rust". Async Rust is widely
            used, with 52% of the respondents in the 2023 Rust survey indicating that they use Rust to build server-side or backend applications.

            Bring the Linux kernel closer to building on stable Rust

          <p class="flex-grow-1">
             The experimental support for Rust development in the Linux kernel is a watershed moment for Rust, demonstrating to the world that Rust is indeed capable of targeting all manner of low-level systems applications. And yet today that support rests on a number of unstable features, blocking the effort from ever going beyond experimental status. For 2024H2 we will work to close the largest gaps that block support.
